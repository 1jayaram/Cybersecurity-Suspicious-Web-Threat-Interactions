# Cybersecurity-Suspicious-Web-Threat-Interactions

This project focuses on detecting anomalous and suspicious web interactions that may indicate cyber threats like phishing, malware, or unauthorized access. Using log data containing URLs, timestamps, and web request patterns, the system applies Autoencoder-based anomaly detection, a type of unsupervised deep learning model that learns normal traffic patterns and flags unusual behavior as threats. Key features such as IP addresses in URLs, suspicious keywords, or domain anomalies are extracted to enhance detection capability. This approach allows real-time monitoring of web traffic and is highly relevant in todayâ€™s cybersecurity landscape where traditional rule-based systems often fail to detect novel attacks. Applications include enterprise firewall monitoring, cloud access security, and threat intelligence platforms.
